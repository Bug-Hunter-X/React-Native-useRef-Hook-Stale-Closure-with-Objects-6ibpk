This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with an object as its initial value.  If you modify the object's properties directly, React won't detect these changes, leading to a stale closure. This is different from modifying an array, which can trigger updates. Consider this example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef({ count: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    myRef.current.count++; // This doesn't trigger a re-render
    console.log(myRef.current.count); // The count will increment but the UI won't update
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myRef.current.count}</Text>  
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};
export default MyComponent;
```
